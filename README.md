# SMS-Spam-Detection
This project uses a multinomial naive bayes algorithm to create a model for detecting spam SMS messages. 
The model is trained on a dataset of labeled SMS messages and is able to accurately classify new messages as either spam or not spam. 
The project includes preprocessing steps for cleaning and preparing the data, as well as evaluating the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
